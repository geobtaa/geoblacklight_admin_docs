# Views

There are two main document views: Documents and Form View.

## Documents

The Documents shows a list of all records in the index. These can be selected or filtered. The search functionality mimics the GeoBlacklight interface with a list of facets on the left to filter records. 

It also features:

* Date Range filter: to select items by Date Created (when they were first added).
* Imports: Shortcut to filter to specific CSV metadata imports.
