# Admin Tools

The Admin Tools menu item is a dropdown listing various functions. These functions are divided into groups separated by a horizontal line.

## Group 1: Primary Actions

### Documents

This link shows all the documents in the Dashboard. (It is a duplicate of the default homepage.)

### Imports

This tool enables users to upload CSV files of metadata records.  See the [Import records](import.md) page for more details.

### Bulk Actions

This link shows a list of batch edits a user has generated, such as setting the Publication State for a set of records. Bulk Actions cannot be created or edited from this page - it is currently only a list of previous actions. However, it may be useful to check on the status or history of an action.

## Group 2: Attachments and External Links

### Assets

This link directs to a dashboard displaying uploaded objects. Click on the "Upload Assets" button to manually upload a dataset, thumbnail, or supplemental metadata file.

### Access Links

This tool is for Licensed Data records and used for attaching log-in links from multiple institutions. See the Secondary Tables section of the [Import records](import.md) page.

### Download Links

This tool enables users to upload CSV files for items with multiple downloads. See the Secondary Tables section of the [Import records](import.md) page.

## Group 3: Blazer

This is a plugin dashboard for analyzing records.

## Group 4: Schema and Form Administration

### Elements

This feature provides a user interface for editing the metadata schema. Once edits have been made, the server will need to be restarted. (Contact our lead developer to make this change)

### Form Elements

This interface allows the user to reorder and change the elements displaying in the form view.

## Group 5:  Users

Administrators can add or remove users with this page.
