## Dashboard (Home page)

The Dashboard shows a list of all records in the index. These can be selected or filtered. The search functionality mimics the GeoBlacklight interface:

* a search bar at the top for text searches
* a list of facets on the left to filter records
* a Date Range filter above the facets to select items by Date Created (when they were first added).

!!! tip

	Click on the button "View in Geoportal" to open a new tab with the record live in GeoBlacklight. Note: the record is still viewable live via this button, even if it is a Draft or Unpublished.

## Notifications

The Notificiations tab shows downloadable file links. When a user requests a set of files for export, GeoBlacklight Admin will dynamically generate the download. Once the files are ready, the Notifications tab will display a red visual indicator.
