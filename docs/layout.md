## Dashboard (Home page)

The Dashboard shows a list of all records in the index. These can be selected or filtered. The search functionality mimics the GeoBlacklight interface:

* a search bar at the top for text searches
* a list of facets on the left to filter records
* a Date Range filter above the facets to select items by Date Created (when they were first added).
